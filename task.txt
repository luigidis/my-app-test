1. Create two new Components (manually or with CLI): WarningAlert and SuccessAler
2. Output them beneath each other in the AppComponent
3. Output a waning or success message in the Components
4. Style the Components appropriately (maybe some red/green text?)

Use external or internal templates and styles!
Feel free to create more components, nest them into each other or play around with different types of selectors
